# Project 3 – Building a Classifier (Titanic)

**Author:** Blessing Aganaga  
**Date:** November 2025  

This project applies three machine learning classification models — **Decision Tree**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Neural Network (MLP)** — to predict passenger survival from the **Titanic dataset**.

Each model was trained and evaluated across multiple feature cases (`alone`, `age`, and `age + family_size`).  
The models were compared based on **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.  
Results were summarized in a Markdown table and visualized using **confusion matrices** and **decision tree plots**.

**Key Highlights:**
- Demonstrated feature engineering (`family_size`, numeric encoding)
- Used stratified sampling for balanced train/test splits
- Compared unscaled vs. scaled models for fairness
- Reflected on model performance and insights for deployment
